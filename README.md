# Brain Tumor Segmentation using 2D U-Net
Hi, 

I am Keval Sharma. I am a student in Masters in Computer Science at Lakehead University and this is my master's project.

I am have developed an automatic image segmentation algorithm which segments tumor from MRI scans of brain. For this purpose, I used 2D U-Net as a baseline architecture whichis built with the use of 2D Convolutional Neural Network.
